            <h1 id="h1">Why would you do this?</h1>
            <p id="p1">This website is supposed to be a kind of tool to be used in many different ways, a place to find stuff easily, a <i><u>maybe</u></i> helpful
            site, to learn something, or just somewhere to find silly things.
            </p>
            <h1 id="h1">Other stuff to keep in mind</h1>
            <p id="p1">You'll need to understand that this website is completely made from one person who has limited knoweledge/hasn't learned everthing there is to know about things like HTML, CSS or JavaScript. And additionally, this website will only be updated when I have time to fix bugs/glitches or maybe adding new stuff every once in a while as the only way to contact me is through people who know me on discord.</p>
